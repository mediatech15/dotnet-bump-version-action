      Control how to version. Options:
        - major
        - minor
        - patch
        - prerelease
        - premajor
        - preminor
        - prepatch
      Examples:
        major: 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0
        minor: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
        patch: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
        premajor: 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0-preTag.1
        preminor: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0-preTag.1
        prepatch: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1-preTag.1
        prerelease: 1.0.0-preTag.0 -> 1.0.0-preTag.1
      This action aims to be as semver compliant as dotnet will allow. This means that FileVersion and AssemblyVersion will either
        - Have a 0 for the 4th version segment if no pre-release tag exists
        - Have the build number of the tag if a pre-release tag exists
        - Because of this all generated pre-release tags will not be bare and include a .BUILD_NUMBER
        - If no semver compliant fields the action will error

        - Branch: task.Fix -> 1.0.0-task.Fix.1
